# The area of a triangle can be computed using the following formula, where b is the
# length of the base of the triangle, and h is its height:
# area = b Ã— h / 2


base = float(input("Enter base of triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter height of triangle: "))

area = (base * height) / 2

print("Area of triangle: ", area)
